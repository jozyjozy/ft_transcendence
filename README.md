# ft_transcendence
Project consisting in the development of a website where people can create an account or login if they have one. The registration is via form or the 42's API. Once logged in they can play pong vs each other or an AI. They can also create room to chat in, check each others profiles and statistics. Everything is a SPA.
Due to a lack of time the front is auite minimal and needs to be reviewed.
The website use Django and Websockets to enable people to play together and chat.
